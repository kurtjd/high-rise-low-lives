# High-Rise: Low-Lives
A cyberpunk-themed traditional roguelike. Instead of delving deeper into a dungeon battling fantasy creatures, you've been hired to climb to the top of the High-Rise, the looming headquarters of the MegaCorp, to steal cutting edge tech that could change everything. Fight, sneak, and hack your way past hired mercs, crazed robots, gangsters, cyborgs, and more as you use everything at your disposal to stay alive and complete your mission.
