High-Rise: Low-Lives
====================
Background: It is the year 21XX, and corporations have grown in power. After selling most public lands to pay off debt, the US government has lost most of it's control of land and resources. Inadvertently, the corporations have grown exponentially more powerful with the control of land and resources. With their new power, the corporations continued to expand bullying individuals and local governments off private land for further control of resources. Now, nearly all land in the US is controlled by corporations for the purpose of resource extraction and manufacturing. With the US government now virtually powerless, it lost its ability to enforce laws. Thus, one corporation came to be so powerful that it now controls 98% of all business and land in the country, and is essentially the de-facto ruler of America. Due to most land being controlled for resource extraction, the human population has been condensed into three mega-cities which also makes them easier to control.

Concept: In the future an evil megacorp has taken over the world. Technology has improved exponentially while living conditions continue to suffer. You have been hired by a rival to enter the headquarters of this evil megacorp, knwon as the High-Rise, a giant looming building located in the heart of the megacity, in order to reach the top floor and find a way to retrieve a piece of mysterious tech.

Megacorp: Ruled by an industrious young woman, the past several years she disappeared from the public eye and has become a mystery. Some say she is dead others say she controls things from the shadows. The reality is she has been searching for a way to transcend the human body and become one with cyberspace using her vast wealth and connections in order to maintain full control of humanity for eternity.
