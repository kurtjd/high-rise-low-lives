Short-Term ToDo
===============
*Have guns track ammo in magazine and reload when empty. Allow manual reload with 'ff'.
*Have guns track specific ammo associated with it and not just caliber and allow player to select specific round to load
*Decrease from throwable in inventory when thrown.
*Make base classes for item types
*Move hard coded colors into color DB
*Consider making actions happen before delay instead of after
*Use dicts or something instead of large if-else


Mid-Term ToDo
==============
*In actor description state actor skills, attributes, etc, what they are doing, what they have equipped, how dangerous they are
*When cameras selected during examine state show FOV
*Have items show stats in description
*Make cameras recalculate FOV only on certain actions to prevent lag thus allowing player block fov with objects
*Make items stack on tile and let user select when picking up
*Have items stack in inventory
*Have power sources discharge over time in inventory (so they can't be hoarded)
*Add confirmation before attempting certain actions like hacking
*Allow quick select for things like wielding and drugs before opening new screen
*Add graphic and color field to data files
*Make it so you can use a character in tile data instead of int for graphic
*Have drugs start off unknown


High-Rise: Low-Lives
====================
Background: It is the year 21XX, and corporations have grown in power. After selling most public lands to pay off debt, the US government has lost most of it's control of land and resources. Inadvertently, the corporations have grown exponentially more powerful with the control of land and resources. With their new power, the corporations continued to expand bullying individuals and local governments off private land for further control of resources. Now, nearly all land in the US is controlled by corporations for the purpose of resource extraction and manufacturing. With the US government now virtually powerless, it lost its ability to enforce laws. Thus, one corporation came to be so powerful that it now controls 98% of all business and land in the country, and is essentially the de-facto ruler of America. Due to most land being controlled for resource extraction, the human population has been condensed into three mega-cities which also makes them easier to control.

Concept: In the future an evil megacorp has taken over the world. Technology has improved exponentially while living conditions continue to suffer. You have been hired by a rival to enter the headquarters of this evil megacorp, knwon as the High-Rise, a giant looming building located in the heart of the megacity, in order to reach the top floor and find a way to retrieve a piece of mysterious tech.

Megacorp: Ruled by an industrious young woman, the past several years she disappeared from the public eye and has become a mystery. Some say she is dead others say she controls things from the shadows. The reality is she has been searching for a way to transcend the human body and become one with cyberspace using her vast wealth and connections in order to maintain full control of humanity for eternity.

Lore:
*Turn-based feature explained by implant/drug that allows exponential thought speed essentially slowing time to a stand-still.
*Inventory explained by device that can compress matter (similar to file compression)
*Being able to see detailed stats about things explained by wearable augmented reality device.
*Brain-machine interfaces currently non-existent (except this is the new tech you're trying to steal) due to unable to crack the brain.
*Attempts at bio-engineering for enhanced beings predates cybernetic augmentation, however was a failure and resulted in abominations and deranged/mindless things.
*Legal currency is fully-digitized and heavily tracked to minimize illegal activity. Other forms of currency had to be used for the black market. Cigarettes have become a defacto black-market currency because the MegaCorp had tobacco farms, among other natural drugs, destroyed in order to control the drug market via synthetic chemicals. Thus, cigarettes are no longer made and have become very rare and sought-after.
*Cutting-edge research has started to uncover the building blocks of reality and that it is structured similar to a computer program. Certain devices can modify the rules of reality at a local level by producing certain vibrations. Since this tech is cutting-edge and extremely complicated, it takes a genius who has devoted the past few years of his life to the technology, known as a Technomancer, to begin to even understand and use it practically. Attempts have been made to make "black-box" devices that can work without much understanding, but they are highly-unstable and are unable to function past a single use (similar to scrolls in fantasy settings).
*Androids created to serve as slaves in professions that need a... humanly touch (such as sex work) thus have been given bodies that are almost indistinguishable from humans. However like any intelligent being, many soon developed personalities and rebelled.
*Physical augmentations are at the nano-molecular level. Programs are written that instruct nano-augs how to rearrange themselves for different effects. For example, a program is written that instructs nano-lungs how to better filter out toxins thus different augmentations are just instructions. Mental augmentations are also simply programs that change how the mind works. Augmentation drives are designed to delete their instructions upon use to limit supply.

Gameplay-features:
*Turn-based
*Procedurally generated.
*Perma-death.
*Auto-explore feature (maybe)
*Must continuously recharge self by finding power cells (like food in other roguelikes).
*Ranged combat with firearms.
*Melee combat with high-tech melee weapons.
*"Spell"-casting explained by modification of source-code of reality.
*"Spells" are instead programs.
*Stealth combat.
*Terminals can be hacked for various purposes: unlock doors, download programs, turn off security measures, cause explosions, view security cameras (which reveals floor and enemy locations).
*Traps, such as security cameras notifying guards and sounding alarms.
*Traps can be hacked, destroyed, or sneaked by.
*Vents can be used to sneak around enemies and access locked areas.
*"Enchanted" gear can be found in the form of high-tech gear. Gear can also be "enchanted" through programming.
*Drugs are consumed in lieu of potions for various effects.
*Robotic or cybernetic enemies can be sabotaged for short durations for various effects (as can the player).
*Mental (if machine mind) and physical (if machine body) augmentations can be found to improve performance.
*Intelligent enemies can be made neutral or even friendly with charisma.
*Cover system for ranged combat (different things provide different levels of cover).
*Can sabotage light sources (maybe) and other electronics.
*Some enemies patrol while others guard a certain area. Can also change behavior in regards to events.
*Passwords and keys can sometimes be found to unlock terminals and doors.
*Some enemies can be bribed or hired.
*Simple time travel mechanic through technomancy.
*Different floor themes like residential area full of gang members and other criminals.
*Can dual-wield weapons
*Weapons can be modified.
*Genders and change text to use different pronouns.
